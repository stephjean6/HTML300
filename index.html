    <p>Hi Dave, I failed miserably at this homework.  JavaScript hasn't come as easy to me as HTML/CSS did.</p>
    <p>I couldn't complete the homework as you assigned (after hours and days of studying), so I decided to try simply summing two input fields; my attempt at that also failed.</p>
    <p>I really appreciated your comments at the end of class about not getting heartburn over this course.  Much appreciated!  I purchased Jon Duckett's book and made it through the first 100 pages.</p>
